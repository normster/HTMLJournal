HTMLjournal is a quick and basic journaling tool that allows users to create timestamped journal entries consisting of images and text.

Tutorial:
1. Compile executable:
```
make journal
```
2. Place images to be journaled in the main HTMLjournal directory, NOT in /images/.
3. Create new journal entry:
```
./journal new
```
4. Add image:
```
./journal image <file name>
```
5. Add text:
```
./journal text
```
6. Repeat steps 4, 5 to satisfaction of entry.
7. Create next entry:
```
./journal new
```

I like to use this Chrome image downloader (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/image-downloader/cnpniohnfphhjihaiiggeabnkjhpaldj?hl=en-US) extension to grab pictures from my browser, and Gyazo to take screenshots.
